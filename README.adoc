== SPIKE RasPi Transporter

[.lead]
"Spike Raspi Transporter" is the auto transportation vehicle using LEGO SPIKE PRIME <<spike>>  kit and Raspberry Pi 4 <<raspi>> .

=== Motivation


I used the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 <<ev3>> kit to build an auto transporter and use it in lectures and training.
However, EV3 will be discontinued in 2021 and will be difficult to obtain in the future.
Therefore, I decided to create a similar transporter "Spike Transporter" using the LEGO SPIKE PRIME kit, which is the successor product.

=== Structure of spike transporter

This vehicle consists of several units.

==== Base unit

The base unit is a drive unit that runs on two main wheels and a rear ball.

This unit is used a SPIKE's large hub and two medium motors.

==== Line monitor

The line monitor unit is watcher the transportation route(black line) for the transporter running.

This unit is used a SPIKE's color sensor.

==== Wall Detector

The wall detector unit recognizes side walls of delivery destinations and garages.

This unit is used a SPIKE's ultrasonic sensor.

==== Carrier and Container

The carrier unit is a place where cargo (container) is loaded. It monitors whether there is cargo or not.

The carrier unit is used  SPIKE's force sensor (like a touch sensor).

==== Raspberry Pi mounter

This unit is for mouting Raspberry Pi.
Depending on your case, you may need to make some changes.

==== Battery mounter

This unit is for mouting mobile battery.
Depending on your battery, you may need to make some changes.

==== Overview

The following figure shows how all units are connected.

After mounting the Raspberry Pi and mobile battery, it will look like the following figure.
